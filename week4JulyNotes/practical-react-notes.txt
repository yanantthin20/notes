How to install the React.js on your computer=>part1  
           - npx create-react-app practical-app
	npm start=>localhost:3000

How to create React.js Components  =>part2

-React is all about building components and putting components together to build bigger things
-JSX, looks a little bit like HTML and it kind of it's a mix between HTML and then also being able to do JS stuff inside that and display variables.
-we can create many components as we want and we can put everyone in the render function and we can build bigger components by putting those components  
 together

Passing Data to component in React.js =>Part-3
- this.props is an object,
-<h1 className="App-title">this.props.title</h1>
-In above tag, this.props.title is a text not variable. we can wrap this in curly braces lik {this.props.title}
-<Header title ="Hello" num={5}/>(String don't need curyl braces)
-Everything else you want to pass into component you have to wrap and curly braces
-Objects are not valid as a React child
-So, {JSON.stringify{this.props.myOjb}}(JSON.stringify takes an object and turns into a string)
-props are just passing the data to your custom components

Importing Components in React.js =>Part-4
-a good rule of thumb is you want to have about one component in each file
-Whenever we are using JSX, we need to import react
-to be able to import in another file, you need to export
-export default, you can only export one thing
-if I want to export more than one thing from a file, I'll have to use a different type of export which is called a named export
-When export, if we don't use default , we must use curly braces and use the name of the class that we gave(can use const instead of default)

State in React.js => Part-5
-Whenever you use the constructor , you need to say super on the props 
-Regular function need to bind to access state property , but arrow function don't need
-If you want to update state property, use setState()
-Whenever we call this.setState(), it 's going to do two things
-First, it's going to set the new state
-Second, it's going to call render function.

How setState works in React.js =>Part-6
-this.setState() is asynchronous so what is means is the value of the state does not immediately change after calling this function .


Form components in React.js => Part-9
-<input/> => uncontrolled field because we're not storing what the user typed inside of react
-controlled field => you do store with the user typed inside of react because this allows you to  add some stuff like validation.

Fetch Data From on API in React.js => Part-12
-fetch() is going to allow us to make the HP request to get the data.

Deploying Create React App to Surge and Netlify => Part-16
First- npm run build
-Two different techniques- 1. using a site called surge, it 's free and allows you to deploy to your front-end application
			(need to run this command 
				-npm install --global surge
				-surge)
		          2. netlify (https://app.netlify.com/start) (from github)
