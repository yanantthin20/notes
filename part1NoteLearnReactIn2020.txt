What is react?
         /*-React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.( specially for single-page applications)
         -It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.
         -React also allows us to create reusable UI components.*/(from google)

What does react app made of?
         -React is basically made of components so there are different components exactly in HTML like you do a div.

Why use component?
        -Resuable chunks of code 
        -Good structure 
	components are good because they give you structure and they allow you to think about you want in terms of units and these units (easily testable,
              shareable, debuggable)
       -self-contained code
       -Think in terms of "responsibilities"


React Component

	class components				                     |				 functional components

							        |
	class Welcome extends React.Compoent{                               |                              function Welcome(props){
		render(){                                                              |                                              
		       return <h1>Hello ,{this.props.name}</h1>;       |                                                  return <h1>Hello ,{props.name}</h1>;
		}
	}                                                                                       |                              }
	
	-have to declare it using Keywords                                         |                              -make readable codes
	-render method inside that class                                            |                              -like a normal function
	-can ony use state with only in class components.                    |


Type of data in React                                                                        

            Props
	     -A simple variable
	     -Used for passing between components
	     -Think functional arguments

            State
	    -A variable that can be updated
	    -Used to implement "Reactiviy"
	    -Used to trigger a Re-render
	    -Responsible for all the interactivity of the app
	    (from google
		React has another special built-in object called state,Which allows components to create and manage their own data.
                           So unlike props, 
                                      components  cannot pass data wiht state,
		 but they can create and manage . State should never be updated explicitly)

Data Flow in React	(is a quite strict , readable and usable code)

	One-way direction data flow - is a pattern that works nicely with React.
				-components don't modify the data that they receive.
			  	- only listen for changes of this data and may be provide new value but they don't update the actual data.
